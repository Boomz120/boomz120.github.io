                         I have an... interesting family. My parents divorced when I was 7 and I've lived with my Mom ever since. I'm grateful to have my Mom, whose always been there to support me. I see my Dad every once in a while, but not very often. I have two older half-siblings, Tracey and Eric, both are in their early 30s. Then there is my older sister, Zoe, who's 25, and my younger half-brother, Caelan, who's 8.

                        Yes, my dog gets his own section, because he's awesome. We rescued Trooper when he was 3 years old, after he had to have a toe amputated because his first owner neglected his broken foot for a year. Hence the name Trooper. Even having a rough puppyhood Trooper is still a giant goofball and teddy bear.
